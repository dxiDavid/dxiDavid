# Introduction

Hello, I'm David Gichuru and welcome to my corner of the web. I'm a Web Developer and junior network engineer I'm passionate about tech and `love learning new things` I am a `detail-oriented` and `result-driven` individual. I'm also a `team player` who thrives in a cooperative environment and a `quick learner` and always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

# Passions

## 1. CyberSecurity

This is what got me into tech. I stumbled upon some videos on YouTube where I saw security professionals doing some pretty interesting things with the browser and the Kali Linux command line and I was sold. At the time I did'nt know what they were doing but I knew I eventually wanted to do it :smile:

## 2. Networking

I developed an interest for networking as soon as I first learned about basic web protocols. Since then I decided to explore the world of networking with Cisco and took a CCNA course and earned some credetials along the way.

## 3. Web Development

I really like the web and want to make some of the most beautiful websites in existence. I enjoy `front-end development` and warming up to backend development. I have a number of completed projects and solved challenges that you can view and learn from. Just make sure to attempt the challenge before taking a look at how I solved it :wink:
