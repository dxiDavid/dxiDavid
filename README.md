Hello, I'm David Gichuru and welcome to my corner of the web. I'm a Web Developer and junior network engineer I'm passionate about tech and `love learning new things` I am a `detail-oriented` individual who takes pride in ensuring that every aspect of a task is carefully considered and executed to the best of my ability. I'm also a `team player` who thrives in a cooperative environment and a `quick learner` and always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

# Interests

The Particular fields of tech I'm interested in are as follows

## 1. CyberSecurity 

This is what got me into tech. I stumbled upon some videos on YouTube where I saw security professionals doing some pretty interesting things with the browser and the Kali Linux command line and I was sold. At the time I did'nt know what they were doing but I knew I eventually wanted to do it :smile:

<br>

### These are my acheivements so far:

## 3. Web Development 
I really like the web and want to make some of the most beautiful websites in existence. I enjoy `front-end development` and warming up to backend development.
